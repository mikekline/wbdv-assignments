## **General Review**


***Robertsspaceindustries*** is the website for the upcoming crowd-sourced video game, Star Citizen.

>***Star Citizen*** is an upcoming multiplayer space trading and combat game developed and published by Cloud Imperium Games
for Microsoft Windows. Development of the game began in 2011 and was made public through its original Kickstarter campaign in 2012. Development is led by director Chris Roberts, and is being mostly financed from a large private crowdfunding campaign of over US$250 million. The game's full launch was originally anticipated to be in 2014, but significant expansion of gameplay features have led to postponement. 
>
>***Squadron 42***, a single-player story-driven game set in the same universe as Star Citizen, is also being developed.

The goal of the site is to provide information about the game, as well as to continue to bring in revenue by way of crowd-sourcing with
pledges for in-game vehicles and real world merchandise. It also provides information on the development and telemetry for the game and acts as a community hub for backers of the project. It also contains a vast amount of in game lore, an encyclopedia, a map of the game, a road map to development and many more features. As the game is currently in a playable alpha state, work remains on both the game and website as a work in progress. Many features are still to be added, including a mobile web app with friends list and other features accessible in game.

Upon first visiting the website you are greeted with a pop-up on where to navigate. It isn’t very clear on exactly what is what if you have never been to the site before. However if you know a bit about the project then it makes more sense (quick little description of each panel would be good). You can choose between the main multiplayer game, the single player game or the ongoing development.

Clicking on the first one takes you to a page with a hero image which you can click for a video which shows off a bit of the game. After the hero image there is a clickable logo, and next to that is some links to about how to play and some media. with a nice clear call to action button that takes you to how to actually set up and play the game. Below that there is some general information Presented in a nice easy to read layout that is easy to scan.

Clicking on the second panel is much like the first, but for the single player game rather than the multiplayer. Again there is a hero image with video link. Links that scroll down the page. An action button for purchase. Sections with Small amount of information, but expand with more text when clicked on. Which tailor user experiences and only go into detail when the user wants to learn more. 

By clicking on the third panel or just by closing the pop up, you get the meat and potatoes of the website. Which displays all of the news and information that is released (including videos, fiction, and guides), the community hub, and info about the development and funding. All laid out with cards.


At the very top of all of the pages include things like:

- Links to the different pages
- Progressive web apps like:
    - Community forum
    - Game launcher
    - Interactive map
    - Encyclopedia
- Online store for pledges and merchandise
- Support centre
- Log in/sign up for an account

As well as a site map in the footer of all the pages, as not to clutter up the top. Making the user experience more pleasing with out all of the clutter.


## **Mobile and Accessibility**

On mobile everything lines up nicely with cards. There are two drawer menus at the top with a nice lay out. However there is a lack of thumb accessibility other than scrolling.  Large images, videos and text are laid out in a way that is easy to scan.  There is use of some semantics with header, nav in header and footer, and some sections. There is no use of alt tags on images for when images are not displayed. Descriptive links are observed and tell you about the content that you will be linked to and contrast of text is pretty good.


## **Notes and Improvements**

- Allows exploration of site without the need to log in.
- Inputs should have labels for sign in forms and images should have alt tags.
- The text in right menu on mobile could be larger to help with accessibility.
