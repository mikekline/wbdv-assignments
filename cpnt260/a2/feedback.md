- Only one column is needed for this design since everything is centred.
- Your css is well organized but a few blank lines and comments would help with readability.
- The bold text causes your text to overflow with the social icons on Firefox.
- Your choice of row sizing could cause problems with different text lengths. I changed it so the text will grow/shrink with the body text.
- The grid placement of the profile image is non-standard but it seems to work.
